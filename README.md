# Local RAG Assistant

**Author:** Antonino Mirabile

## 🧠 What is a Local RAG?

- **RAG** (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines intelligent document search (“retrieval”) with answer generation using artificial intelligence (“generation”).
- **Local** means everything runs on your own computer/server: no data is sent to external cloud services.

## What does this project do?
- Allows you to **upload and index documents** (e.g., PDFs) locally.
- You can **ask questions** via a web interface: the system finds the most relevant text snippets in your documents and displays them as answers.
- **Stateless**: documents are visible only in the current session, but search works even after a refresh (as long as the server is running).

## Current limitations
- The current system only performs **retrieval**: answers are text extracts from documents, not “reasoned” or generated.
- **No LLM** (Large Language Model) is integrated: do not expect synthetic or “intelligent” answers like ChatGPT.

## How to evolve
- If you have a powerful server, you can **install a local LLM** (e.g., Ollama, Mistral, Llama2, etc.).
- By integrating the LLM, the system will be able to generate synthetic and “human-like” answers from your documents, all locally and with full privacy.

## Advantages
- **Privacy**: your data always stays on your server.
- **Customization**: you can upload your own documents and, in the future, your own models.
- **No cloud costs**: you only pay for the hardware.

## Next steps
- Install and configure a local LLM.
- Integrate the backend to use the LLM for answers.
- Optimize chunking, retrieval, and UI.
